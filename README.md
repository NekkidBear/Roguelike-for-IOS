# Roguelike-for-IOS

I'm developing a roguelike in python to help me learn coding, touchscreen interfaces and game dev.
This is an abandoned project. I originally intended to create a roguelike game in python for distribution on IOS and other mobile platforms. Unfortunately time and resources got away from me, and I have moved on to other projects. I may revisit it in the future though.
